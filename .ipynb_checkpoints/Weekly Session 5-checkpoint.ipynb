    "There are two aspects to this week's investigations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The first is more technically oriented - we will reorient our thinking towards calculating results to a  given *tolerance*, rather than with a fixed number of steps.  We will then explore the idea of extrapolating to a more accurate answer - Romberg integration is an example of the more general approach of Richardson extrapolation, which is also applied in other contexts (in particular, solution of differential equations).\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, integration with a fixed  number of *steps* is not useful for automated use.  If your code must calculate millions of integrals (or even just hundreds of integrals), and you need a certain accuracy, it is simply impractical for you to intervene and hand-pick the number of steps for each integral.  You could just choose a \"really big'' number of steps for all integrals, even when they are not needed, but this will make your code impractically slow (perhaps factors of hundreds slower than it needs to be).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the approach outlined in Newman Section 5.3, let us write a function which uses the trapezoidal rule to calculate with $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, $\\ldots$ steps (*i.e.*, $~2^i$ steps), until the error estimate falls below a specified tolerance.  \n",

    "function should follow's Newman's approach, *i.e.*, \"reusing'' the value of the previous integral to avoid evaluating the integrand $f$ at the same point more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, let us see how how much of an improvement this gives. Suppose we ultimately need, say, $2^{5}$ steps.  How many times would we have to evaluate $f$ if we evaluated the integral from scratch with each iteration ($1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, $\\ldots$ steps)?  How many times would we have to evaluate $f$ if we reused the prior integrals, instead?"
